.TH opendkim-anonstats 8 "The OpenDKIM Project"
.SH NAME
.B opendkim-anonstats
- OpenDKIM statistics anonymization tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendkim-anonstats
[options] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-anonstats
prepares a statistics report for submission by anonymizing domain names
using a hash and some optional locally-provided data.

Statistics are collected by the
.I opendkim(8)
filter into a local file.  Depending on the configuration of that program,
the data may or may not have the domain names anonymized (hashed) to prepare
for submission to a public database.  If a local site wishes to generate clear
reports for local use and then hash them for public submission, this tool
can be used for that purpose.

The converted data are written to standard output.  If
.I file
is not specified, standard input is assumed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -p prefix
Specifies a string to prefix to domain names being hashed.  This guarantees
that reverse-engineering which domains are contained in the report is
[approximately] impossible.  Without this, domain names are simply hashed
which means they can be guessed easily if they are common, or eventually
if brute-forced.  However, hashed domain names cannot be used for
correlation between reporting sites, reducing the utility of the submitted
data.

This is the same thing that the
.I StatisticsPrefix
setting does in the filter's configuration file.
