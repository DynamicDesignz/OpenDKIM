Subject: OpenDKIM v2.10.0 and v2.9.3 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.10.0 and
v2.9.3, now available for download from SourceForge.

This is a split release to accommodate requirements of acceptance into
distributions.  2.9.3 contains all bug fixes, while 2.10.0 also contains new
features and other major changes.

2.10.0 is a major release.  Upgrade is recommended.  Of particular note:
Author Domain Signing Practices (RFC5617) is now officially a "Historic"
protocol, and support for it has been removed.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for these versions:

2.10.0		2014/12/27
	Feature request #182: Remove "AddAllSignatureResults".  All signature
		results will now be added via Authentication-Results header
		fields.  Requested by Tomki Camp.
	Feature request #180: Rename "LDAPSoftStart" to "SoftStart" and apply
		it to SQL connections as well.  Requested by Daniel Kauffman.
	Feature request #179: Add "IgnoreMalformedMail" option.
	Fix bug #183: Discontinue support for ADSP.  This removes the
		following configuration file items:
		AddAllSignatureResults	LocalADSP
		ADSPAction		NoDiscardableMailTo
		ADSPNoSuchDomain	On-PolicyError
		BogusPolicy		SendADSPReports
		DisableADSP		SenderHeaders
		LDAPSoftStart		UnprotectedPolicy
	Make "rrvs" and "smime" recognized Authentication-Results methods.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #157: Add dkim_mail_parse_multi().
		Suggested by Alessandro Vesely.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #185: Add dkim_set_dnssec().  Patch
		from Alec Peterson.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #183: Discontinue support for ADSP.  This
		means all of the following:
		- the dkim_policy_t type has been removed
		- the DKIM_POLICY_* constants have been removed
		- the DKIM_PRESULT_* constants have been removed
		- passing DKIM_OPTS_SENDERHDRS to dkim_options() now
		  results in an error
		- the DKIM_PSTATE structure has been removed
		- all of the following functions have been removed:
		  dkim_policy(), dkim_policy_dnssec(),
		  dkim_policy_getqueries(), dkim_policy_getreportinfo(),
		  dkim_policy_state_free(), dkim_policy_state_new(),
		  dkim_policy_syntax(), dkim_getpolicystr(),
		  dkim_getpresult(), dkim_getpresultstr(),
		  dkim_set_policy_lookup(), dkim_test_adsp()
	LIBOPENDKIM: DKIM_LIBFLAGS_STRICTHDRS now also confirms syntactical
		validity of the From field before proceeding with a signing or
		verifying operation.  Suggested by Wez Furlong.
	CONTRIB: Fix bug #207: Clean up the "stats" directory.
	CONTRIB: Add "repute" directory which could eventually replace the
		PHP implementation.  Submitted by Daniel Black.
	CONTRIB: Patches to systemd and init/redhat from Steve Jenkins.

2.9.3		2014/12/27
        Fix bug #177: Plug leaking "result" structures when OpenLDAP is in use.
	Truncate configuration file lines at carriage return.
	Replace overlapping strlcpy() with memmove() in dkim_get_key_file().
		Reported by Daniel J. Luke.
	Patch #32: Re-arrange the execution logic to drop privileges in
		proper order.
	LIBOPENDKIM: dkim_header() is now a lot more strict about the input
		it will accept (see RFC5322 Section 2.2).
	LIBOPENDKIM: Tighten relaxed modes to break on only DKIM-defined
		whitespace characters.  Problem noted by Elizabeth Zwicky.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #208: If a signature fails to verify for either
		reason (header hash mismatched or body hash mismatched), set
		DKIM_SIGERROR_BADSIG so that Authentication-Results doesn't
		report a failure with "no signature error".
	TOOLS: Feature request #178: Add "-F" flag to opendkim-genzone so
		records are created with the FQDN.  Patch from Andreas Schulze.
	REPUTATION: Handle parameters safely in repute.php.  Reported by
		Daniel Black.
