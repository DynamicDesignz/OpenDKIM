Subject: OpenDKIM v2.10.2 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.10.2,
now available for download from SourceForge.

This release reverts the errant removal of a configuration setting during the
2.10.0 release when ADSP support was discontinued.  A couple of other minor
fixes are also included.  Upgrade is recommended if you're having problems
with anything identified in the release notes, but is not necessary
otherwise.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.10.2		2015/05/10
	Fix bug #221: Report a DKIM result of "policy" if MinimumKeyBits
		or UnprotectedKey cause the signature to result in a "pass"
		override.  Reported by Kurt Roeckx.
	Fix bug #227: Revert removal of SenderHeaders configuration setting.
		Document that it is now limited to signature selection.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #226: Deal with header fields that are
		wrapped before there's any content.  Reported by
		Alessandro Vesely.
	CONTRIB: Update to contrib/systemd/opendkim.service.in from
		Steve Jenkins.
