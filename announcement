Subject: OpenDKIM v1.2.1 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.2.1, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release fixes a number of small but annoying problems found since the
v1.2.0 release, and one DB compatibilty issue that affects people using
Sleepycat DB v1.85 (common on most systems) that are also using the "stats"
feature.

If you have v1.2.0 working, you don't need to upgrade.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.2.1		2009/12/23
	Fix a disconnect in configuration regarding "On-KeyNotFound".
	Fix a type mismatch in dkimf_db_open() with respect to Sleepycat
		version 2 libraries, and a bug in dkimf_db_walk() with
		respect to Sleepycat version 1 libraries.
	Report _FFR_REPORT_INTERVALS in "-V" output.
	LIBAR: Tidy up some compile-time warnings.
	BUILD: Correct name of "bodylength_db" feature.
	BUILD: Define VERIFY_DOMAINKEYS in build-config.h when
		"--with-domainkeys" is enabled.
	BUILD: Define USE_DB in build-config.h when "--with-db" is enabled.
