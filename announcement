Subject: OpenDKIM v2.6.8 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.6.8, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a security release.  It places restrictions on the use of keys that
are small enough that they can be compromised within a small period of time.

This release is being done in parallel with 2.7.0.  It pulls the minimum key
size limit from 2.7.0 onto the 2.6.x release branch.  There are no other
changes.
