Subject: OpenDKIM v2.5.2 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.5.2, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a minor bug fix release.  Most of the fixes have to do with the
build system or compile-time issues and not run-time ones.  So if you have
already packaged or installed 2.5.0.1, you don't need this release.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.5.2		2012/04/09
	Fix bug #SF3496208: Replace stats/opendkim-genstats with a perl
		script so it's far more efficient.
	Fix bug #SF3514793: Pass proper flags to libdb when creating
		temporary LDAP caches.  Problem noted by Sergey Romanov.
	Fix a crash bug when using LocalADSP with a message with no
		parseable From: field.  Problem noted by John Merriam.
	Fix a crash bug when using LDAP with authentication when LDAPAuthUser
		is not defined.  Problem noted by Christian Roessner.
	STATS: Fix bug #SF3510729: Convert stats/opendkim-gengraphs to a perl
		script.
