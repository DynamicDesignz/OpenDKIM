Subject: OpenDKIM v2.6.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.6.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a major feature release.  There are also some bug fixes, though none
of them are critical to operation.  Thus, updating is not mandatory unless
access to the new features is desired.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.6.0		2012/06/07
	Feature request #SF3495969: Add support for Lua v5.2.0.  Requested
		by Rolf Sonneveld.
	Feature request #SF3502777: Log all authentication results rather than
		relying on logging of Authentication-Results header fields.
		Requested by Andreas Schulze.
	Feature request #SF3512286: Add "LDAPSoftStart" flag so the filter
		doesn't abort on startup when LDAP is not available.
	Feature request #SF3512836: Add _FFR_SOCKETDB, which enables support
		for a generic socket data set.
	Feature request #SF3514982: Add Erlang data set support.  Patch
		provided by Andre Nathan.
	Feature request #SF3516253: Update to newest "repute" working group
		documents, which mainly means adding JSON support and
		promoting application-specific extensions to the top level
		in the reputon structure.
	Feature request #SF3518593: Add support for OpenLDAP's MDB as a
		data set backend.  Requested by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Feature request #SF3519002: Put reason information inside a "reason"
		tag in Authentication-Results header fields rather than in
		comments.
	Feature request #SF3521000: Log hostname and daemon name (taken from
		macros) when logging "no MTA name match".  Requested by
		Andreas Schulze.
	Feature request #SF3524756: Add ability to request TCP keepalive
		features via the OpenLDAP client library.  Requested by
		Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Feature request #SF3529233: Add odkim.get_envfrom() to all Lua scripts.
		Requested by Charles Cazabon.
	Fix bug #SF3518877: Separate variable expansion from literal text in
		opendkim-genkey.
	Fix bug #SF3522883: Allow TLS for ldapi URIs.  Problem noted by
		Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Fix bug #SF3527428: Construct the LDAP URI list properly, rather than
		only keeping the last one, and add failover code.  Problems
		noted by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Patch #SF3522895: Add contrib/ldap/opendkim.ldif.  Contributed
		by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Activate _FFR_XTAGS.
	Remove _FFR_SELECT_CANONICALIZATION.
	LIBAR: Fix bug #SF3444318: Do proper buffer size calculations to
		avoid valgrind warnings about references to unaddressable
		space.  Reported by Todd Lyons.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3496041: Remove _FFR_PARSETIME.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3516653: By default, treat a syntax error
		in an ADSP record as an NXDOMAIN.  Add new library flag
		DKIM_LIBFLAGS_REPORTBADADSP to restore the original
		behaviour.  Suggested by Scott Kitterman.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3524865: Disallow generation of signatures
		where signer and signing domain don't match per the DKIM
		specification.  Add DKIM_LIBFLAGS_DROPSIGNER which, if set,
		will still generate signatures in that case, but with the
		signer omitted so the signature is still compliant.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF3425384: Add missing support for compiling
		against libevent2, which is an option for unbound.
		Noted by Andreas Schulze.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF3475799: Don't do a manual check for libdb.a.
		Use the AC_CHECK_* macros instead.
	DOCS: Fix bug #SF3518864: The license for IETF documents is not
		compatible with free software licensing, which makes packaging
		a bit of a chore.  Replace all the text files in the "docs"
		directory with a single HTML page that includes links to
		all the things we used to include here.  Requested by
		Scott Kitterman.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3110059: Move opendkim-reportstats from
		contrib/stats to stats, making it fully supported.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3525786: Add opendkim-expire script.
		Requested by Andreas Schulze.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3528652: Allow a specific list of domains,
		possibly read from a file, for opendkim-gengraphs and
		opendkim-genrates.  Requested by Andreas Schulze.
