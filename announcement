Subject: OpenDKIM v1.1.2 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.1.2, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a patch release, fixing some minor problems, adding one new
feature (FFR), and incorporating a number of API and build environment
improvements in preparation for future releases.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.1.2		2009/11/01
	Under _FFR_SENDER_MACRO, need to check the value of "SenderMacro"
		in the configuration file.  Noted by Daniel Black.
	Feature request #SF2873901: Add _FFR_REDIRECT which optionally
		redirects messages that fail verification to a specific
		address, storing the original recipients in
		X-Original-Recipient: header fields.  Suggested by
		Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Have dkim_dns_set_callback() return
		DKIM_STAT_NOTIMPLEMENT if the underlying resolver doesn't
		have a callback facility.  Suggested by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Move internal-only types and macros from dkim.h
		to dkim-internal.h.  Based on an idea from Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add in all previously optional functions so that the
		API is invariant regardless of selected features.  Add
		dkim_libfeature() as a way to detect availability of features
		at runtime.  Suggested by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Some global namespace consolidation.  Suggested by
		Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2882206, patch #SF2880986: Handle libtre
		installations where "--enable-system-abi" was selected.
		Reported by Stevan Bajic; patch from Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Convert libar compilation to the libtool method.
		Suggested by Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Minor autoconf fixes, contributed by Daniel Black.
