Subject: OpenDKIM v2.9.1 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.9.1, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a bug fix and general cleanup release, much of it around packaging
and building for various environments.  Upgrade is not required if there
are no bug fixes in here that look familiar to you.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.9.1		2014/03/15
	Feature request #177: Add "LuaOnlySigning" so that only the Lua setup
		script makes signing requests; suppresses automatic application
		of the signing table.  Requested by Daniele Orlandi.
	Fix bug #185: odkim.signfor() wasn't processing its arguments
		properly.  Reported by Daniele Orlandi.
	Fix bug #199: Fix use of uninitialized buffer when generating
		SMTP response strings due to ADSP rejections.  Problem
		noted by Ache.
	Fix infinite loop when mlfi_connect() is called with a hostname
		starting with a "." character.  Reported by Philip Guenther.
	Fix loading of refiles when trailing spaces are present in the value.
		Problem noted by Amal Francis.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Only call dkiml_dns_close() if there was a
		dkiml_dns_service handle set by dkiml_dns_init().  Also,
		when closing, reset that handle to NULL.
	LIBOPENDKIM: The various dkim_dns_set_*() functions, when passed a
		NULL function pointer, merely store it, making the
		corresponding function a no-op.  Previously, doing
		so restored the default.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Have dkim_sig_getreportinfo() return descriptors
		(if available) regardless of the signer's reporting parameters.
		Problem noted by Wez Furlong.
	BUILD: Fix bug #188: Clean up last remnants of libstrl.
	BUILD: Fix bug #190: Check for HAVE_SUN_LEN in opendkim-db.c.

	BUILD: Fix bug #192: Different test for libevent, from Patrick
		Laimbock.
	BUILD: Fix bug #193: Don't throw away user-provided compilation
