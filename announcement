Subject: OpenDKIM v1.2.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.2.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release offers a number of new features.  The internal database code
has been completely re-done so that one can use a comma-separated list,
a file, a Sleepycat database, or an ODBC/SQL database for key-value lookups
on any configurable set of data.  The filter now offers the ability to
attach multiple signatures in one single operation, and to verify and
re-sign messages passing through the filter without having to compute
separate hashes for each operation.  The library now lets callers request that
even syntactically invalid signatures be processed so that the caller can
get a more accurate picture of what actually arrived.

There were also a few library bugs fixed.  The most interesting bug fixes
involved relaxed header canonicalization and chunk processing.  There's
also been some package rearrangement in the area of the libopendkim tests
and the VBR code.

The build system will now attempt to use pkg-config, if available, to
determine the location of required include and library files, and also
exports pkg-config files during installation for the libraries contained in
the package.  Substantial other build system reworking has also been done.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.2.0		2009/12/08
	Feature request #SF2873902: Overhaul the database backend code so that
		features that use external files or databases can be in any
		of several supported formats.  This will make adding new
		external data sources and formats simpler, and obviates the
		need for a bunch of individual feature requests.  This may
		have a few backward compatibility issues with respect to
		the configuration file.  Feature requested by Daniel Black.
	Feature request #SF2873900: Add optional support for OpenDBX for
		connecting to ODBC and SQL backend databases.  Requested
		by Daniel Black.
	Add "On-PolicyError" setting, allowing continuation of processing
		when an ADSP query fails.
	Activate _FFR_MULTIPLE_SIGNATURES, allowing optional addition of
		more than one signature per message passing through the
		filter.
	Add _FFR_RESIGN which allows binding of a signing handle to a
		verifying handle so that only one body hash needs to be
		run when a message will be re-signed as-is.  Suggested
		by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Move VBR functions from libopendkim into their own
		new library, libvbr.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Rename the rfc2822_*() parsing functions to have
		"dkim_" prefixes, and rename their containing file
		accordingly.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fixes in relaxed body canonicalization and chunk
		processing.  Problems noted by Masumi Taketomi Parekh
		of Yahoo!.
	LIBOPENDKIM: New library flag DKIM_LIBFLAGS_BADSIGHANDLES which
		asks the library to tolerate signature syntax errors and
		make such signatures available for limited inspection
		rather than completely ignoring them.  Requested by Masumi
		Taketomi Parekh of Yahoo!.
	BUILD: Split up library assignments between libopendkim and opendkim,
		taking advantage of libtool.  Based on a patch by Daniel Black.
	BUILD: When possible, limit the symbols exported as part of
		libopendkim to only those listed in dkim.h.
	BUILD: Generate opendkim.conf.5 man page containing all features,
		including FFR, annotated with if they are included and their 
		experimental status (for FFRs).
	BUILD: Improve static linking against openssl as noted by Roman
		Gelfand.  Compiles against openssl version 1.0.0-beta4 now. 
	BUILD: Provide pkg-config files {opendkim,vbr,ar}.pc for use by 
		other applications.
	BUILD: Fix up libresolv detection.
	BUILD: Add pkg-config checks for openssl, tre and opendbx packages to
		determine their installed library locations. Automate 
		versioning and deployment.
	BUILD: Added m4 macro library directory with updated ax_pthread.m4.
	BUILD: Moved feature, _FFR and library #defines from Makefiles to 
		build-config.h. Added macros for FFR and FEATURES.
	BUILD: Add support for versions of libtre older than 0.8.0.
	BUILD: Move all libopendkim tests into their own subdirectory.
