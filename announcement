Subject: OpenDKIM v2.0.0 (Eve) released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.0.0 (code named
"Eve"), now available for download from SourceForge.

This is a major new feature release.  The main new features include:

	o Support for OpenLDAP for storing keys and signing configuration.
	  This should enhance scalability for sites with lots of separate
	  domains and keys to manage.

	o Support for fine-grained policy control via three Lua script
	  hooks.  See the opendkim-lua(3) and opendkim.conf(5) man pages
	  for details.  It should be possible to perform any configurable
	  policy-related function already available via these scripts,
	  except with far more control.  Example scripts are included.

	o Separation of signing policy and key management into two different
	  new configuration items, "KeyTable" and "SigningTable".  The
	  previous way, using KeyList (or "-K" from the command line), has
	  been removed.

	o A tool to generate a public key zone file based on the contents
	  of the KeyTable.

	o Build configuration features for generating code coverage and
	  profiling data.

	o A new milter protocol simulation tool for conducting unit tests
	  on this filter (or any milter-aware filter).  It also uses
	  Lua as a scripting engine.

There are as usual several bug fixes as well as some build system and
compile-time cleanliness improvements.

There were some minor changes to the library.  If you are using the library
now and are not having trouble with it, no upgrade is required.  However,
the new library has a few noteworthy changes:

	o Prior to v2.0.0, dkim_eom() when verifying would only run
	  signatures until the first good one was encountered.  Now,
	  by default, all of them will be run.  This is required to
	  provide correct support for ADSP in the filter.  There is a new
	  library flag that can be used to request the previous behaviour.

	o Prior to v2.0.0, dkim_sign() would only accept keys in PEM
	  format.  Now, base64-encoded DER format is also accepted.  This
	  was added to support key management via LDAP or SQL.

	o There is new function applications can use at runtime to determine
	  what version of libopendkim has been linked.

The code coverage and profiling data mentioned above yielded several
optimizations for the library that also appear in this release.
