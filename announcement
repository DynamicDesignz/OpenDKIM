Subject: OpenDKIM v2.5.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.5.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a major new feature release.  It also includes a few important bug
fixes and some code updates to keep up with changes in evolving specifications.
Upgrading is recommended.

There are two major architectural changes in this release:

1) The statistics subsystem was originally added to support the work of the
DKIM working group at the IETF to produce an interoperability report, needed
to advance the DKIM standard to the next maturity level.  That has now been
completed, and we thank those that participated in making this possible.
As of this release, the statistics reporting subsystem has been repurposed
into something that reports messages, their passing/failing signatures, and
an indication of whether or not the message was identified as spam somehow.
This is being done to support some ongoing research and development of an
open DKIM-based domain reputation system.  The visible changes are: (a) it
is no longer possible to submit anonymized data, as such is not useful to the 
new purpose of this piece of the project; and (b) the set of data being
submitted is substantially smaller.  This means those of you participating
may wish to re-evaluate your participation, though obviously we would be
pleased to have you continue.  Those that do start or continue to submit
this data will be eligible to participate in the reputation experiments
as they unfold.

2) DomainKeys, the predecessor to DKIM, is no longer supported as of this
version.  Sites wishing to continue to do DomainKeys verification will need
to seek out and install other software.

	Feature request #SF3385816: Discontinue DomainKeys support.
	Feature request #SF3393282: Update ARF output per
		draft-ietf-marf-authfailure-report-03 et seq.
	Feature request #SF3406814: Add ability to invoke chroot().
		Requested by Andreas Schulze.
	Feature request #SF3477908: Update DKIM reporting per
		draft-ietf-marf-dkim-reporting-10.
	Add "WeakSyntaxChecks" suppressing some short-circuiting error checks
		on syntax.  Requested by Todd Nagengast. 
	Allow a set of test files to be passed via "-t" rather than just one.
	Add _FFR_REPUTATION, and several new support libraries (in the
		libut/ and reputation/ directories) for doing DKIM-based
		reputation evaluations of arriving messages.  Full
		documentation of the algorithms will appear in an upcoming
		white paper.  This also includes several new configuration
		options that make use of reputation data pulled from servers:
			ReputationCache
			ReputationCacheTTL
			ReputationLimits
			ReputationLowTime
			ReputationMinimum
			ReputationLimitModifiers
			ReputationRatios
			ReputationSpamCheck
			ReputationTimeFactor
		For now these are briefly documented in reputation/README.
		As this subsystem matures, they will be fully documented in
		opendkim.conf(5).
	Fix bug #SF3471520: Don't crash when the first line of a configuration
		file is an "Include" instruction.  Reported by Dilian
		Wesselinov Palauzov.
	Fix bug #SF3475149: Apply RFC2254 encoding to LDAP queries.
		Problem noted by Yoshiaki Yanagihara.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3317160: Per RFC6376, remove
		granularity checks.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3385768: Add dkim_privkey_load(),
		allowing validation of a private key before reaching
		end-of-message.  Requested by Heikki Gruner.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3423226: Copy header field name lists
		instead of using the caller's copy.  Suggested by
		Heikki Gruner.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Update list of header fields that should be signed
		per RFC6376.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Don't report the absence of "c=" as an error, since
		there is a default.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add DKIM_SIG_CHECK() macro.  Suggested by Heikki
		Gruner.
	LIBAR: Fix bug #SF2917856: Rename "ar.h" to "async-resolv.h" since
		"ar.h" is already in common use.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3397903: Drop all support for data needed
		for the DKIM Implementation Report, as it has been completed.
		Leave stuff that's useful for reputation R&D.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3402857: Modify opendkim-spam to be able
		to write update records to statistics files.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3439384: Make opendkim-importstats more
		backend-agnostic.  Requested by Andreas Schulze.
	TOOLS: Add opendkim-testmsg, for signing/verifying messages without
		all the milter code being invoked.  Requested by
		Todd Nagengast.
	CONTRIB: Add LDAP documentation and examples.  Provided by
		Patrick Ben Koetter.
