Subject: OpenDKIM v2.0.4 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.0.4, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a minor bugfix release.  The main change is a fix to logic in the
filter that prevented the AlwaysAddARHeader feature from working.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.0.4		2010/05/17
	Fix logic enabling AlwaysAddARHeader.  Reported by Thomas Arnett.
	Return SMFIR_SKIP if available when reaching mlfi_body() if the
		filter is not interested in the body, such as on an unsigned
		message.
	Add more unit tests (but many more are needed).
	LIBOPENDKIM: In dkim_eoh() when verifying, set the DKIM error string
		to something if there was at least one signature on the
		message but none passed.
	MILTERTEST: Add SMFIR_SKIP as a testable milter reply code.
	MILTERTEST: Add mt.chdir().

Please use the mailing lists at http://lists.opendkim.org/ to report problems.
