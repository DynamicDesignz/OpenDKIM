Subject: OpenDKIM v1.1.1 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.1.1, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release tidies up a number of minor coding issues that generally only
occurred during unusual error conditions and thus went undetected until now.
Also, with the publication of RFC5617, ADSP is now official and thus the
name to be used when annotating results of those checks has changed.  A
correction was made to handling of ADSP when the retrieval of an ADSP
record ran into trouble.  And finally, a new FFR is available that allows
sender selection based on MTA macros instead of just headers.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.1.1		2009/10/09
	Plug a number of potential but minor memory and file handle leaks,
		remove some dead code, guard against NULL dereferences, fix an
		errant return code check, fix a double-free(), and several
		other fixes found by a code analysis tool, used by courtesy
		of Cloudmark.
	Change "x-dkim-adsp" to "dkim-adsp" in Authentication-Results header
		field code now that RFC5617 is published.
	Apply "On-DNSError" setting when policy queries fail.
	BUILD: Some compilation fixes and type cleanup.  Based on patches
		provided by Daniel Black.
	Add _FFR_SENDER_MACRO: Determine the message sender based on the
		contents of a macro instead of on a header field.
		Based on a patch from Ondrej Sury.
