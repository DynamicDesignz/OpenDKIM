includes improved support for builds on machines with multiple DB installs,

2.1.3		2010/07/15
	Fix build when enabling LDAP.
	Fix portability issue with DB 1.x.  Patch from Kaspar Brand.
	Fix bug #SF3026261: Don't try to open the statistics database before
		possibly changing userid.  Reported by Andreas Schulze.
	Plug a couple of potential but minor memory leaks, avoid some NULL
		dereferences, rewrite some clearly incorrect code, and several
		other fixes found by a code analysis tool, used by courtesy
