Subject: OpenDKIM v2.5.1 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.5.1, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a minor bug fix release.  Most of the fixes have to do with the
build system or compile-time issues and not run-time ones.  So if you have
already packaged or installed 2.5.0.1, you don't need this release.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.5.1		2012/03/15
	Fix bug #SF3496131: Fix query cache build problem.  Reported by
		Dilian Wesselinov Palauzov.
	Fix bug #SF3500660: Add Date: header field to generated reports.
		Reported by Andreas Schulze.
	BUILD: A few subsidiary libraries need to know about -lresolv on
		systems that need it.  Reported by Scott Kitterman.
	STATS: Add "-E" command line flag to opendkim-importstats, forcing
		an abort on any input error.

Please use the mailing lists at http://lists.opendkim.org/ to report problems.
Bug reports and feature requests can be made through the project trackers,
which can be found via http://www.opendkim.org.
