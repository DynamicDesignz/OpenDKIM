Subject: OpenDKIM v2.5.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.5.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a major new feature release.  It also includes a few important bug
fixes and some code updates to keep up with changes in evolving specifications.
Upgrading is recommended.

There are two major architectural changes in this release:

1) The statistics subsystem was originally added to support the work of the
DKIM working group at the IETF to produce an interoperability report, needed
to advance the DKIM standard to the next maturity level.  That has now been
completed, and we thank those that participated in making this possible.
As of this release, the statistics reporting subsystem has been repurposed
into something that reports messages, their passing/failing signatures, and
an indication of whether or not the message was identified as spam somehow.
This is being done to support some ongoing research and development of an
open DKIM-based domain reputation system.  The visible changes are: (a) it
is no longer possible to submit anonymized data, as such is not useful to the 
new purpose of this piece of the project; and (b) the set of data being
submitted is substantially smaller.  This means those of you participating
may wish to re-evaluate your participation, though obviously we would be
pleased to have you continue.  Those that do start or continue to submit
this data will be eligible to participate in the reputation experiments
as they unfold.

2) DomainKeys, the predecessor to DKIM, is no longer supported as of this
version.  Sites wishing to continue to do DomainKeys verification will need
to seek out and install other software.
