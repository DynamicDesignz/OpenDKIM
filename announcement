Subject: OpenDKIM v2.6.6 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.6.6, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a minor bug fix release.  Upgrade is not required unless something
shown below is something of interest to you. 

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.6.6		2012/07/18
	LIBAR: Fix bug #SF3544522: Not all systems define a "_len" member for
		the sockaddr structures.  Reported by Stevan Bajic.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3545490: If the body handed to the library was
		missing a trailing line terminator, then dkim_canon_closebody()
		would end the hashes with some data not included.  Now, if
		DKIM_LIBFLAGS_FIXCRLF is set, it will detect this condition
		and correct it; if not, an error is returned.  Problem noted
		by James Erickson.
	LIBOPENDKIM: If the job ID passed in during handle creation includes
		slashes and temporary file creation is enabled, convert the
		slashes to dots in the temporary file template.  Problem
		noted by James Erickson.
