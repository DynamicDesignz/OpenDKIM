The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.4.3		2011/12/26
	Fix bug #SF3400670: Send ADSP failure reports when rejecting
		a message.  Reported by Andreas Schulze.
	Fix bug #SF3419149: Add MaximumSignedBytes to opendkim-config.h.
		Reported by Adam Bernstein.
	Fix bug #SF3441240: Appy ReportBccAddress when generating ADSP
		reports.  Reported by Richard Rognlie.
	Fix bug #SF3447199: Fix logic preventing the application of the
		BodyLengthDB.  Problem noted by Richard Rognlie.
	Fix Authentication-Results generation with "AddAllSignatureResults"
		enabled.  Reported by Todd Nagengast.
	Fix a crash bug when trying to handle certain malformed header fields
		in verify-only mode.  Reported by Todd Lyons.
	Improve error checking in the callback provided to libunbound to
		avoid crashes.  Problem noted by Todd Lyons.
	Cope with versions of Sleepycat DB that crash when asking for a file
		descriptor for in-memory databases.  Problem reported by
		Todd Lyons.
	Don't override "On-NoSignature" when "Quarantine" is set.  Reported
		by Jarry Jeremy.
	Ignore header field names that contain semi-colons, as they produce
		syntactically invalid signatures.  Problem noted by
		Heikki Gruner.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3465400: Don't use "new" as a parameter name
		in dkim.h since that's an error for C++.  Reported by
		Amit Schreiber.
	LIBOPENDKIM: NOERROR is the same as NXDOMAIN for the purposes of
		the ADSP existence check.  Problem noted by Todd Nagengast.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Return DKIM_STAT_SYNTAX from dkim_header() if the header
		field name contained a semi-colon.
	LIBAR: After computing a timeout, if the fractional seconds portion
		adds to exactly a second, convert that amount to seconds.
		Previous versions only converted when the fractional portion
		exceeded a second.  This led to threads that spin
		indefinitely.  Problem noted by Todd Lyons and Gary Mills;
		forensic evidence revealing the problem at long last provided
		by Todd Lyons.
	STATS: Fix a crash bug in opendkim-importstats due to improper handling
		of NULL returns from SQL.  Reported by Andreas Schulze.
