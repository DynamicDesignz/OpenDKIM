Subject: OpenDKIM v2.0.1 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.0.1, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release contains minor fixes to a few bugs reported since the v2.0.0
release.  The main fixes among them are a build issue that occurs when
specifying "--with-openldap" while configuring the build, and a potential
crash bug encountered when reading keys from files on disk prior to signing.

Also of note is a change in the license terms being used by the project.
We have changed from the older four-clause BSD license to the more
practical three-clause BSD license.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.0.1		2010/03/20
	Fix bug #SF2964376: Don't use dkim_getsighdr() internally during
		signing as it presumes signatures will fit within a bounded
		character array and sometimes (e.g. with extensive data in
		a "z=" tag) they don't, leading to signing failures on valid
		messages.  Reported by James R. Marcus.
	Fix bug #SF2969700: Remember to NULL-terminate key data loaded from
		disk before using it.
	Don't use MAXHOSTNAMELEN as its value is unreliable.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Return an error from dkim_get_key_dns() if the
		query string is too big for a hostname buffer, rather than
		sending the truncated string to DNS anyway.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Ensure string termination in dkim_sig_getidentity()
		when calling dkim_qp_decode().  Patch from Stefan
		Schulze Frielinghaus.
	LIBOPENDKIM: In dkim_eom_sign(), don't change the handle's overall
		state before erroring out if the chunking state is invalid.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2969812: Don't install Lua sample files or man
		pages when --with-lua isn't specified.  Patch from
		Kaspar Brand.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2965318: Don't define USE_LUA when LDAP is enabled.
		Problem noted by Guillaume Castagnino.
	LICENSE: Change from 4-clause BSD license to 3-clause BSD license.
