Subject: OpenDKIM v2.3.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.3.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a major new feature release with a few minor bug fixes included.
There are also a few new experimental extensions available for those
interested in participating.  A few worth noting:

- the final Lua script can now do RBL queries
- VBR support has been enhanced
- statistics gathering has also been enhanced, with a few more pieces of data
  being tracked and a few improvements made to anonymization of data
- several simplifications have been made to various configuration settings
- experimental support for Authorized Third-Party Signers (ATPS) was added
- compile-time support for GNUTLS as a replacement for OpenSSL was added
- will now use an opendkim.conf in the default location if it's there
