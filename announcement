Subject: OpenDKIM v2.0.0 (Eve) released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.0.0 (code named
"Eve"), now available for download from SourceForge.

This is a major new feature release.  The main new features include:

	o Support for OpenLDAP for storing keys and signing configuration.
	  This should enhance scalability for sites with lots of separate
	  domains and keys to manage.

	o Support for fine-grained policy control via three Lua script
	  hooks.  See the opendkim-lua(3) and opendkim.conf(5) man pages
	  for details.  It should be possible to perform any configurable
	  policy-related function already available via these scripts,
	  except with far more control.  Example scripts are included.

	o Separation of signing policy and key management into two different
	  new configuration items, "KeyTable" and "SigningTable".  The
	  previous way, using KeyList (or "-K" from the command line), has
	  been removed.

	o A tool to generate a public key zone file based on the contents
	  of the KeyTable.

	o Build configuration features for generating code coverage and
	  profiling data.

	o A new milter protocol simulation tool for conducting unit tests
	  on this filter (or any milter-aware filter).  It also uses
	  Lua as a scripting engine.

There are as usual several bug fixes as well as some build system and
compile-time cleanliness improvements.  The code coverage and profiling
data mentioned above yielded several optimizations for the library that
appear in this release.  However, there have been no major bugs fixed or API
changes made to the library in this release, so anyone using the library
need not upgrade.
