Subject: OpenDKIM v2.10.0 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.10.0, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a major release.  Upgrade is recommended.  Of particular note:
Author Domain Signing Practices (RFC5617) is now officially a "Historic"
protocol, and support for it has been removed.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.10.0		2014/??/??
	Feature request #182: Remove "AddAllSignatureResults".  All signature
		results will now be added via Authentication-Results header
		fields.  Requested by Tomki Camp.
	Feature request #180: Rename "LDAPSoftStart" to "SoftStart" and apply
		it to SQL connections as well.  Requested by Daniel Kauffman.
	Feature request #179: Add "IgnoreMalformedMail" option.
	Fix bug #177: Plug leaking "result" structures when OpenLDAP is in
		use.  Problem reported by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Fix bug #183: Discontinue support for ADSP.
	Make "rrvs" and "smime" recognized Authentication-Results methods.
	Truncate configuration file lines at carriage return.
	Replace overlapping strlcpy() with memmove() in dkim_get_key_file().
		Reported by Daniel J. Luke.
	Patch #32: Re-arrange the execution logic to drop privileges in
		proper order.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #157: Add dkim_mail_parse_multi().
		Suggested by Alessandro Vesely.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #185: Add dkim_set_dnssec().  Patch
		from Alec Peterson.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #208: If a signature fails to verify for either
		reason (header hash mismatched or body hash mismatched), set
		DKIM_SIGERROR_BADSIG so that Authentication-Results doesn't
		report a failure with "no signature error".
	LIBOPENDKIM: dkim_header() is now a lot more strict about the input
		it will accept (see RFC5322 Section 2.2).
	LIBOPENDKIM: Tighten relaxed modes to break on only DKIM-defined
		whitespace characters.  Problem noted by Elizabeth Zwicky.
	CONTRIB: Fix bug #207: Clean up the "stats" directory.
	CONTRIB: Add "repute" directory which could eventually replace the
		PHP implementation.  Submitted by Daniel Black.
	TOOLS: Feature request #178: Add "-F" flag to opendkim-genzone so
		records are created with the FQDN.  Patch from Andreas Schulze.
	REPUTATION: Handle parameters safely in repute.php.  Reported by
		Daniel Black.
