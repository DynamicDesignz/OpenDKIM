Subject: OpenDKIM v2.1.2 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.1.2, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a bug fix release.  The bulk of the fixes involve changes with the
way the filter makes use of OpenDBX (for SQL backend environments) and
repairs a couple of crash bugs.  It also makes miltertest compatible with
older versions of libmilter and restores some limited backward-compatibility
that is still desirable.  Finally, it cleans up some aesthetic issues and
an incorrect internal DB call that could cause false errors with some versions
of Berkeley DB.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:
