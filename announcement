Subject: OpenDKIM v2.7.1 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.7.1, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a bug fix release, patching a few minor crash conditions that can
be triggered by certain database operations.  It also fixes up command line
argument processing for opendkim-genkey, and plugs a memory leak in the
reputation code discovered in a code review.  These issues were
unfortunately not detected during the beta period for 2.7.0.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:
