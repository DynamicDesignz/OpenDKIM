Subject: OpenDKIM v2.4.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.4.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is primarily a new feature release, along with a few bug fixes.
Upgrading is not mandatory unless, of course, you want access to one of
the features described below.  For most users it should be a direct binary
replacement.

There is one backward compatibility issue, referring to the "BodyLengths"
setting which has been removed.  Instead, see the documentation for
"BodyLengthDB".

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The 2.4.x line of OpenDKIM releases will be the last series
that contains support hooks for DomainKeys.  As of 2.5.0 (late this year or
early next), that support will be discontinued.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.4.0		2011/06/06
	Feature request #SF3060140: Extension of odkim.sign() to include
		maximum signed byte count.
	Feature request #SF3171865: Add _FFR_LUA_GLOBALS, enabling a
		mechanism to maintain state between Lua scripts.
	Feature request #SF3241982: Optionally add an Authentication-Results
		field for all signatures present, not just the first good
		one.
	Feature request #SF3256630: Add _FFR_RATE_LIMIT, enabling hooks for
		post-verification rate controls.
	Feature request #SF3290461: Add optional support for querying a
		memcache daemon via libmemcached.
	Feature request #SF3299041: Be tougher on use of the "l=" tag by
		removing "BodyLengths", renaming "BodyLengthDBFile" to
		"BodyLengthDB", and allowing pattern matches.  This
		effectively activates _FFR_BODYLENGTH_DB as well.
	Feature request #SF3303911: Add "DisableADSP" setting.
	In the stats recording code, only check for a domain match for
		signatures that don't have errors (i.e., short circuit if
		sigerror is not zero).
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF2969516: Teach dkim_chunk() about
		DKIM_LIBFLAGS_FIXCRLF.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3123731: Extend FixCRLF to cover
		header fields.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3151534: Extract DKIM reputation
		support to its own library.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3279589: Add _FFR_XTAGS, adding
		support for generic extension tags in signatures.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Feature request #SF3300738: Add dkim_sig_getqueries()
		and dkim_policy_getqueries() to assist API consumers that
		have their own DNS mechanisms not directly adaptable to ours.
		Requested by Heikki Gruner.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Return an error from dkim_getsighdr() or
		dkim_getsighdr_d() if called after a key load failure.
		Problem noted by Heikki Gruner.
	LIBAR: Check that the descriptor's write socket is writable before
		calling ar_sendquery() when trying to identify open requests
		that need retransmission.
	STATS: Feature request #SF3066106: Add "opendkim-anonstats" tool.
	CONTRIB: Paths in init/redhat/opendkim are now auto-generated.
	Activate _FFR_MAXVERIFY.
