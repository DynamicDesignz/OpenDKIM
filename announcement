Subject: OpenDKIM v1.2.0-Beta0 available

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of the first Beta release of
OpenDKIM v1.2.0, now available for download from SourceForge.  Release
is targeted for around the end of this month.  It can be found in the
"Pre-Releases" directory.

Highlights of this pending release:

- support for OpenDBX, and thus many SQL back-ends
- a common database interface for all data sets, so one can use a
  flat file, a regex file, a comma-separated list, a BerkeleyDB or
  an SQL/ODBC database for any set of data the filter might need
- a new setting allowing control over what action is taken when a policy
  query fails, distinct from other DNS or key retrieval errors
- support for addition of multiple signatures at signing time
- a new FFR enabling a single client to verify and re-sign a message
  transiting through an MTA all in one shot (i.e. no need to calculate two
  full sets of hashes)
- a fix to relaxed body canonicalization
- the ability for a client to request data about signatures with syntax
  errors through the API rather than having the API reject them outright
- VBR functions now live in their own library
- various library cleanup
- extensive build system enhancements including use of pkg-config both
  when preparing to build and when installing libraries, improved resolver
  library detection, updated pthread macros, etc.
- automated man page generation with annotations indicating features
  enabled/disabled at compile time

Please use the mailing lists at http://lists.opendkim.org/ to report problems.
Bug reports and feature requests for beta releases should be made through
the lists and not through the SourceForge trackers.
