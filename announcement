Subject: OpenDKIM v2.2.2 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.2.2, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release fixes a number of minor bugs found since v2.2.1 was released.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.2.2		2010/11/28
	Fix bug #SF2903325: Clean up numerous signed vs. unsigned warnings.
	Fix bug #SF3095782: When VBR is enabled, only perform a query when
		the "md" domain in the VBR-Info header field matches the
		"d" field for any valid signature.
	Fix bug #SF3105993: Better handling of missing records in Lua DB
		lookups.  Reported by Luci Stanescu.
	When reading keys, ensure what's being read is a regular file and
		not something else.
	Complain if TrustAnchorFile names something that can't be opened
		for reading.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Don't complain about multiple records returned if one
		of them was an RRSIG.  Problem noted by Andreas Schulze.
	LIBAR: Rework some I/O logic to avoid a deadlock when the nameserver
		becomes unresponsive during response processing.  Problem
		noted by Gary Mills.
	BUILD: Move all scripts and executables except opendkim to a bin
		directory for adminstrator convenience. They were previously in
		the sbin directory.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF3101842: Fix opendkim-genzone build when OpenDBX
		is in use.
	BUILD: opendkim-testkey can require SASL build information when used
		with OpenLDAP, or Lua information when built with Lua.
	BUILD: Dissociate libopendkim and libunbound, as this is now handled
		through the application rather than the library.
	BUILD: Convert to using git for source code management.
	STATS: Additional reporting improvements.
	STATS: Fix bug #SF3107659: Add additional diagnostic output to
		opendkim-importstats when malformed input is found.
	TOOLS: Handle input generated with and without the _FFR_STATS_I
		extensions.  Problem noted by Graham Murray.
