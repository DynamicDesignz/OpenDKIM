Subject: OpenDKIM v1.2.2 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.2.2, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release contains fixes to a few bugs reported since the v1.2.1 release.
Upgrade is recommended if you are using the opendkim filter as one of the
bugs can result in a filter crash.  None of the bugs are in the associated
libraries, so no upgrade is needed if you aren't using the filter.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.2.2		2010/01/20
	Fix bug #SF2916729: Fix crash when reporting on multiple signatures,
		one of which was invalid in some way leaving its DKIM_SIGINFO
		only partially populated.  Problem noted by Ryan Burchfield.
	Fix bug #SF2919365: A _SOCK_ADDR is just a (struct sockaddr)
		which isn't big enough for IPv6 addresses.  Use a
		(struct sockaddr_storage) instead.  Problem noted by
		Werner Wiethege.
	Fix initalization and processing of ODBX requests.
	Fix DB get operations for Sleepycat versions prior to 2.0.0.

Please use the mailing lists at http://lists.opendkim.org/ to report problems.
Bug reports and feature requests can be made through the project trackers
