Subject: OpenDKIM v2.7.0 released

The Trusted Domain Project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.7.0, now
available for download from SourceForge.

This is a major release, with some new features and some bug fixes.  None
of the fixes or features are critical, so upgrading is not mandatory unless
one of these changes resolves a current issue.

Among the major changes in this release:

o Support for libar (the provided asynchronous resolver library) has been
  discontinued.  Instead, use either libunbound or a thread-safe version
  of the BIND resolver.

o The library will now decline to pass even a valid signature if the matching
  public key is compirsed of too few bits, thus being insecure.  The default
  is 1024.  This can be controlled through the API, and the setting can also
  be adjusted in the filter via the new "MinimumKeyBits" setting.

o Per RFC6648, "X-" header fields are now discouraged.  Accordingly,
  we no longer generate (or expect) any.  This also means the "X-Header"
  configuration file item has been renamed to "SoftwareHeader".  Configuration
  files referring to the old name will need to be updated.

o All copyrights have been updated to reflect that The Trusted Domain Project
  is the copyright holder.  The OpenDKIM Project is now an initiative of that
  organization.
