Subject: OpenDKIM v2.0.3 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.0.3, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This release is non-critical if the filter is working for you already.  It
contains a couple of minor fixes in the filter (one fixes a crash bug on
startup for some Linux systems, one fixes peculiar behaviour when
VERIFY_DOMAINKEYS is enabled), fixes a build issue, and also includes a
number of modern milter compatilbility fixes for our "miltertest" tool.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.0.3		2010/04/30
	Fix bug #SF2986301: Initialize a pointer for AutoRestart before
		using it, avoiding a segmentation fault.
	Fix bug #SF2992571: Rename _FFR_DNS_UPGRADE to _FFR_DNSUPGRADE to
		match what the build system does.  Problem noted by
		Gary Mills.
	Don't let Authentication-Results: logic from DomainKeys verification
		interfere with that of DKIM verification.
	MILTERTEST: Break out of the sending loop in mt_bodyrandom() if
		something other than SMFIR_CONTINUE comes back from the MTA.
	MILTERTEST: Add support for milter's UNKNOWN and DATA steps.
	MILTERTEST: Honour SMFIP_NR_* no-reply requests that may have been
		made by the filter.

Please use the mailing lists at http://lists.opendkim.org/ to report problems.
Bug reports and feature requests can be made through the project trackers
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/opendkim/.

Thanks go out to all of those who contributed to this release.
