Subject: OpenDKIM v2.1.1 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v2.1.1, now available
for download from SourceForge.

This is a bug fix release.  The fixes are concentrated around the Lua
scripting functionality and support of a specific set of milter features
in "miltertest".  If these functions are working for you already or you're
not using them, there is no need to upgrade at this time.

The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

2.1.1		2010/06/22
	Force IPv6 addresses to lowercase, which is about to become standard
		(see draft-ietf-6man-text-addr-representation).  Problem
		noted by Reuben Farrelly.
	Permit configurations in which KeyTable and SetupPolicyScript are
		defined but SigningTable isn't.
	Return an error when making a default signing request if KeyFile and
		Selector were not both specified.
	Fix odkim.sign() so that it pulls from the correct Lua stack index,
		avoiding a NULL dereference and a crash.  Problem noted
		by Jozsef Kovacs.
	Fix bug #SF3015441: Argument processing for odkim.log() was incorrect.
		Problem reported by Jozsef Kovacs.
	Fix bug #SF3016124: odbx_field_value() returns NULL if the requested
		column contains an SQL NULL.  Problem reported by Jozsef
		Kovacs.
	Patch #SF3015439: Fix bugs in data set name parsing (e.g. allow dots
		in fields so that fully qualified hostnames can be given).
		Patch from Jozsef Kovacs.
	MILTERTEST: Fix bug #SF3005615: Observe negotiated SMFIP_NO* protocol
		option bits.
