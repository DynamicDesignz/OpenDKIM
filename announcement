Subject: OpenDKIM v1.1.0 released

The OpenDKIM project announces availability of OpenDKIM v1.1.0, now available
for download from SourceForge.

The main changes in this release include several minor bug fixes, a new
configuration value for dealing with DNS issues, and several build fixes.
The new configuration value may be of particular interest; it allows one
to specify an action to be taken when a key is not found in the DNS,
allowing that case to be treated differently than other DNS errors.
See the updated documentation for more information.

The RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.1.0		2009/09/16
	Feature request #SF2839110: Add _FFR_IDENTITY_HEADER, to set an
       		identity (i=) for signing based on the value found in a
		particular header.  Requested by Florian Sager. 
	Fix inside dkimf_libstatus() to return extended status code 
		4.7.5 if temp-fail is due to key retrieval failure.
	Fix bug #SF2831720: Use new dynamic signature header generation
		code (see below).
	Add new exception handling code "keynotfound" (short form "key")
		and "On-KeyNotFound", which handles keys not found in DNS
		separately from other DNS errors.
	Fixes inside dkimf_libstatus() so that SMTP reply codes get set
		properly for temp-fails.
	Remove _FFR_COMMAIZE.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add dkim_getsighdr_d(), a dynamic-length version of
		dkim_getsighdr().  The old function interface remains
		unchanged for backward compatibility.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add dkim_dstring_printf().
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF2839858: Change "default_senderheaders" list
		to include only "from", per RFC5617.  Problem noted
		by Erik Lotspeich.
	Activate _FFR_SENDER_HEADERS, adding "SenderHeaders" to the
		configuration file.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2841499: Fix building of opendkim tools so that
		they link against libdb when necessary.
	BUILD: Fix building of libopendkim/t-test115 so it agrees with
		what SHA methods are found by libopendkim itself.
	BUILD: Don't bother building libar unless --enable-arlib is specified.
