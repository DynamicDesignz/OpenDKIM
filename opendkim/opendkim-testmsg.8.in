.TH opendkim-testmsg 8 "The OpenDKIM Project"
.SH NAME
.B opendkim-testmsg
- DKIM message tst
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendkim-testmsg
[-d domain] [-s selector] [-k keypath]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-testmsg
signs or verifies an input message.  This is similar to the test mode for 
.I opendkim(8)
except that it does not use the same configuration system or milter interface.
Rather, it is a direct access to the DKIM library with those functions
"out of the way".

The message is read from standard input.  In signing mode, the complete
signed message will then be written to standard output.  When verifying,
there will be no output unless an error occurred.

To sign a message, the three parameters listed in the SYNOPSIS above
must be provided.  If all of them are absent, the input message will be
verified.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -d domain

.TP
.I -k keypath
Specifies the path to the private key file which should be used to sign
the input message.
.TP
.I -s selector
Names the selector within the specified domain that should be included in
the signature.
