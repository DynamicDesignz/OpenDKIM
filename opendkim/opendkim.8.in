.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim
implements the proposed
.B DKIM
standard for signing and verifying e-mail messages on a per-domain basis.

.B opendkim
uses the
.I milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
.B sendmail(8),
to provide DKIM signing and/or verifying service for mail transiting
a milter-aware MTA.

Most, if not all, of the command line options listed below can also be set
using a configuration file.  See the
.I -x
option for details.
.SH DATA SETS
Many of the command line and configuration file parameters will refer to
a "dataset" as their values.  This refers to a string that either contains
the list of desirable values, or to a file that contains them, or (if
enabled at compile time) a database containing the data.

Some data sets require that the value contain more than one entry.  How this
is done depends on which data set type is used.

Which type is used depends on the format of the specification string.
In particular:
.TP
.I a)
If the string begins with "file:", then the remainder of the string is
presumed to refer to a flat file that contains elements of the data set,
one per line.  If a line contains whitespace-separated values, then the
line is preusmed to define a key and its corresponding value.  Blank lines
are ignored, and the hash ("#") character denotes the start of a comment.
If a value contains multiple entries, the entries should be separated by
colons.
.TP
.I b)
If the string begins with "refile:", then the remainder of the string is
presumed to specify a file that contains a set of patterns, one per line,
and their associated values.  The pattern is taken as the start of the line
to the first whitespace, and the portion after that whitespace is taken as
the value to be used when that pattern is matched.  Patterns are simple
wildcard patterns, matching all text except that the asterisk ("*") character
is considered a wildcard.  If a value contains multiple entries, the entries
should be separated by colons.
.TP
.I c)
If the string begins with "db:" and the program was compiled with
Sleepycat DB support, then the remainder of the string is presumed to
identify a Sleepycat database containing keys and corresponding values.
These may be used only to test for membership in the data set, or for
storing keys and corresponding values.  If a value contains multiple entries,
the entries should be separated by colons.
.TP
.I d)
If the string begins with "dsn:" and the OpenDKIM library was compiled to
support that database type, then the remainder of the string is a Data
Store Name describing the type, location parameters and access credentials
for an ODBC or SQL database.  The DSN is of the form:

backend://[user[:pwd]@][port+]host/dbase[/key=value[?...]]

where
.I backend
is the name of a supported backend database mechanism (e.g. "mysql"),
.I user
and
.I password
are optional login credentials for the database,
.I port
and
.I host
describe the destination of a TCP connection to connect to that database,
.I dbase
is the name of the database to be accessed, and the
.I key=value
pairs must specify at least "table", "keycol" and "datacol" values specifying
the name of the table, the name of the column to consider as the key, and the
name(s) of the column(s) to be considered as the values (separated by
commas).  For example:

mysql:://dbuser:dbpass@3306+dbhost/odkim/table=macros?keycol=host?datacol=v1,v2

defines a MySQL database listening at port 3306 on host "dbhost"; the userid
"dbuser" and password "dbpass" should be used to access the database; the
database name is "odkim", and the data are in columns "host" (the keys)
and "v1" and "v2" (the values) inside table "macros".  This example would
thus return two values when a match is found.
.TP
.I e)
If the string begins with "ldap:", "ldaps:" or "ldapi:", it is presumed
to be a space-separated set of one or more LDAP URLs that identify a set
of servers to be queried.  The first one should be a full RFC4516 LDAP URL
indicating a base DN template and optional scope, filter and attribute
names to use in queries.  When constructing a DN template or filter, the
special tokens "$d" and "$D" are replaced with the key being queried and
they key broken into components, separated at "." characters, each
component preceded by "dc=" and followed by "," (so "example.com" would
become "dc=example,dc=com").  If a data set requires multiple values to
be returned, the appropriate attribute names should be given in the correct
order to satisfy such requests.
.TP
.I f)
If the string contains none of these prefixes but ends with ".db", it
is presumed to be a Sleepycat DB as described above (if support for same
is compiled in).
.TP
.I g)
If the string contains none of these prefixes but starts with a slash ("/")
character, it is presumed to be a flat file as described above.
.TP
.I h)
In any other case, the string is presumed to be a comma-separated list.
Elements in the list are either simple data elements that are part of the
set or, in the case of an entry of the form "x=y", are stored as key-value
pairs as described above.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -a peerlist
Identifies a data set of "peers" which specifies clients whose connections
should be accepted without processing by this filter.  The
.I peerlist
should contain in each entry a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"),
IP address, an IPv6 address (including an IPv4 mapped address), or a
CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An entry beginning
with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing exclusions of specific
hosts that are otherwise members of larger sets.  The order of entries
in this data set is therefore significant.
.TP
.I -A
Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the filter
fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
.I fork(2)
loop.  This can be mitigated using some values in the configuration file
to limit restarting.  See
.I opendkim.conf(5).
.TP
.I -b modes
Selects operating modes.
.I modes
is a concatenation of characters that indicate which mode(s) of operation
are desired.  Valid modes are
.I s
(signer) and
.I v
(verifier).  The default is
.I sv
except in test mode (see
.I -t
below) in which case the default is
.I v.
.TP
.I -c canon
Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when signing messages.
When verifying, the message's DKIM-Signature: header specifies
the canonicalization method.  The recognized values are
.I relaxed
and
.I simple
as defined by the DKIM specification.  The default is
.I simple.
The value may include two different canonicalizations separated by a
slash ("/") character, in which case the first will be applied to the
headers and the second to the body.
.TP
.I -C config
Configuration control.  See the CONFIGURATION section for details.
.TP
.I -d dataset
A set of domains whose mail should be signed by this filter.  Mail from
other domains will be verified rather than being signed.
.TP
.I -D
Sign subdomains of those listed by the
.I -d
option as well as the actual domains.
.TP
.I -f
Normally
.I opendkim
forks and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.
.TP
.I -F time
Specifies a fixed time to use when generating signatures.  Ignored unless
also used in conjunction with
.I -t
(see below).  The time must be expressed in the usual UNIX
.I time_t
(seconds since epoch) format.
.TP
.I -h
Causes
.I opendkim
to add a header indicating the presence of this filter in the path of
the message from injection to delivery.  The product's name, version, and
the job ID are included in the header's contents.
.TP
.I -i ilist
Identifies a data set of internal hosts whose mail should be signed rather
than verified.  Entries in this set follow the same form as those of
the
.I -a
option above.  If not specified, the default of "127.0.0.1" is applied.
Naturally, providing a value here overrides the default, so if mail from
127.0.0.1 should be signed, the list provided here should include that
address explicitly.
.TP
.I -I eilist
Identifies a data set of "external" hosts that may send mail through the server
as one of the signing domains without credentials as such.  Basically
suppresses the "external host (hostname) tried to send mail as (domain)"
log messages.  Entries in the
.I eilist
set should be of the same form as those of the
.I -a
option above.  The list is empty by default.
.TP
.I -k keyfile
Gives the location of a PEM-formatted private key to be used for signing
all messages.
.TP
.I -l
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.
.TP
.I -L min[%+]
Instructs the verification code to fail messages for which a partial
signature was received.  There are three possible formats:
.I min
indicating at least
.I min
bytes of the message must be signed (or if the message is smaller than
.I min
then all of it must be signed);
.I min%
requiring that at least
.I min
percent of the received message must be signed; and
.I min+
meaning there may be no more than
.I min
bytes of unsigned data appended to the message for it to be considered
valid.
.TP
.I -m dataset
A set of MTA names (a la the
.I sendmail(8)
DaemonPortOptions Name parameter) whose mail should be signed by this
filter.  If not set, the MTA name is not used when deciding whether or not
a message should be signed.
.TP
.I -M dataset
Defines a set of MTA-provided
.I macros
which should be checked to see if the sender has been determined to be a
local user and therefore whether or not the message should be signed.  If a
corresponding value is specified, the value of the macro must match the
value specified (matching is case-insensitive), otherwise the macro must
be defined but may contain any value.  Multiple tests may be specified,
separated by commas.  The set is empty by default, meaning macros are not
used when deciding whether or not a message should be signed.

A value may be of the form
.I value1[|value2[|...]];
if one or more value is defined then the macro must be set to one of the
listed values, otherwise the macro must be set but can contain any
value.

In order for the macro and its value to be available to the filter for
checking, the MTA must send it during the protocol exchange.  This is either
accomplished via manual configuration of the MTA to send the desired macros
or, for MTA/filter combinations that support the feature, the filter can
request those macros that are of interest.  The latter is a feature negotiated
at the time the filter receives a connection from the MTA and its availability
depends upon the version of milter used to compile the filter and the version
of the MTA making the connection.
.TP
.I -n
Parse the configuration file and command line arguments, reporting any
errors found, and then exit.  The exit value will be 0 if the filter would
start up without complaint, or non-zero otherwise.
.TP
.I -o dataset
Specifies a list of headers that should be omitted when generating
signatures.
If an entry in the list names any header which is mandated by the DKIM
specification, the entry is ignored.  A set of headers is listed in the DKIM
specification as "SHOULD NOT" be signed; the default list for this parameter
contains those headers (Return-Path, Received, Comments, Keywords, Bcc,
Resent-Bcc and DKIM-Signature).  To omit no headers, simply use the string
"-" (or any string that will match no headers).
.TP
.I -p socketspec
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port.
If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  If neither socket type is specified,
.I local
is assumed, meaning the parameter is interpreted as a path at which
the socket should be created.  This parameter is mandatory.
.TP
.I -P pidfile
Writes the process ID of the filter, once started, to the filename given.
.TP
.I -q
Requests that messages which fail verification be quarantined by the
MTA.  (Requires a sufficiently recent version of the milter library.)
.TP
.I -Q
Query test mode.  The filter will read two lines from standard input, one
containing a database description to be opened and one containing a string
of the form "q/n" where "q" is the query to be performed and "n" is the
number of fields to be retrieved.
.TP
.I -r
Checks all messages for compliance with RFC5322 header count requirements.
Non-compliant messages are rejected.
.TP
.I -R
When a signature verification fails and the signing site advertises a
reporting address (i.e.
.I r=user@host
in its policy record), send a structured report to that address containing
details needed to reproduce the problem.
.TP
.I -s selector
Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing messages.
See the
.B DKIM
specification for details.
.TP
.I -S signalg
Selects the signing algorithm to use when generating signatures.
Use 'dkim-filter -V' to see the list of supported algorithms.
The default is
.I rsa-sha256
if it is available, otherwise it will be
.I rsa-sha1.

.TP
.I -t testfile
Evaluates (verifies) an RFC5322-formatted message found in
.I testfile
and exits.  The value of
.I testfile
may be "-" if the message should be read from standard input.
.TP
.I -T secs
Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0 causes an infinite wait.
The default is 5.  Ignored if not using the asynchronous resolver package.
See also the NOTES section below.
.TP
.I -u userid[:group]
Attempts to be come the specified
.I userid
before starting operations.  The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.
.TP
.I -U dataset
Requests that the filter consult a POP authentication database for IP
addresses that should be allowed for signing.
.TP
.I -v
Increase verbose output during test mode (see
.I -t
above).  May be specified more than once to request increasing amounts of
output.
.TP
.I -V
Print the version number and supported canonicalization and signature
algorithms, and then exit without doing anything else.
.TP
.I -W
If logging is enabled (see
.I -l
above), issues very detailed logging about the logic behind the filter's
decision to either sign a message or verify it.  The "W" stands for "Why?!"
since the logic behind the decision is non-trivial and can be confusing to
administrators not familiar with its operation.  A description of how
the decision is made can be found in the OPERATION section of this
document.  This causes a large increase in the amount of log data generated
for each message, so it should be limited to debugging use and not enabled
for general operation.
.TP
.I -x configfile
Read the named configuration file.  See the
.I opendkim.conf(5)
man page for details.  Values in the configuration file are overridden
when their equivalents are provided on the command line until a configuration
reload occurs.  The OPERATION section describes how reloads are triggered.
.SH ACTION CONFIGURATION
The value of the
.I -C
switch is a comma-separated list of settings of the form
.I result=action
which defines what the filter should do with messages that produce
certain results.  Each result and each action has a full name and an
abbreviated name.  Either is accepted.  Below, the abbreviated name appears
in parentheses.
.TP
.I results
.I badsignature
(bad) the signature found in the message did not verify successfully
against the message;
.I dnserror
(dns) an error was encountered attempting to retrieve a public key from
the nameserver;
.I internal
(int) an internal error occurred;
.I keynotfound
(key) the key referenced by the signature was not present in the nameserver;
.I nosignature
(no) no signature was present on the message;
.I policy
(pol) an attempt to retrieve the policy (ADSP) record failed;
.I security
(sec) the message tripped internal security concerns (e.g. unusually large
header blocks).  There is also a special result called
.I default
(def) whose action is copied onto all of the other results.
.TP
.I action
.I accept
(a) accept the message;
.I discard
(d) discard the message;
.I tempfail
(t) temp-fail the message;
.I reject
(r) reject the message.
.PP
In the interests of minimal initial impact, the defaults for
.I badsignature
and
.I nosignature
are
.I accept,
and the default for the others is
.I tempfail.
.PP
Results and actions are processed in order, so use of the
.I default
action can be overridden by later specifications.  For example, using
"def=a,int=t" sets all result actions to "accept" except for internal
errors which will generate a temporary failure.
.SH OPERATION
A message will be verified unless it conforms to the signing criteria,
which are: (1) the domain on the From: address or Sender: address (if present)
must be listed by the
.I -d
command line switch or the
.I Domain
configuration file setting, and (2) (a) the client connecting to the MTA must
have authenticated, or (b) the client connecting to the MTA must be listed in
the file referenced by the
.I -i
command line switch (or be in the default list for that option), or (c)
the client must be connected to a daemon port named by the
.I -m
command line switch, or (d) the MTA must have set one or more macros
matching the criteria set by the
.I -M
command line switch.

For (a) above, the test is whether or not the MTA macro "{auth_type}" is set
and contains any non-empty value.  This means the MTA must pass the value of
that macro to the filter in order for its value to be tested.  Check your
MTA's configuration documentation for details.

When signing a message, a
.I DKIM-Signature:
header will be prepended to the message.  The signature is computed using
the private key provided.  You must be running a version of
.I sendmail(8)
recent enough to be able to do header prepend operations (8.13.0 or later).

When verifying a message, an
.I Authentication-Results:
header will be prepended to indicate the presence of a signature and whether
or not it could be validated against the body of the message using the
public key advertised by the sender's nameserver.  The value of this header
can be used by mail user agents to sort or discard messages that were not
signed or could not be verified.

Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a configuration
file, it will be re-read and the new values used.  Note that any
command line overrides provided at startup time will be lost when this is
done.  Also, the following configuration file values (and their corresponding
command line items, if any) are not reloaded through this process:
AutoRestart (-A),
AutoRestartCount,
AutoRestartRate,
Background,
MilterDebug,
PidFile (-P),
POPDBFile,
Quarantine (-q),
QueryCache,
Socket (-p),
StrictTestMode,
TestPublicKeys,
UMask,
UserID (-u).  The filter does not automatically check the configuration
file for changes and reload.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable(s) can be used to adjust the behaviour
of this filter:
.TP
.I DKIM_TMPDIR
The directory to use when creating temporary files.  The default is
.I /var/tmp.
.SH NOTES
When using DNS timeouts (see the
.I -T
option above), be sure not to use a timeout that is larger than the timeout
being used for interaction between
.I sendmail
and the filter.  Otherwise, the MTA could abort a message while waiting for
a reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a DNS reply.

The POP authentication database is expected to be a Sleepycat DB file
(formerly known as a Berkeley DB) in hash format with keys containing
the IP address in text form without a terminating NULL.  The values of
these records are not checked; only the existence of such records is of
interest.  The filter will attempt to establish a shared lock on the
database before reading from it, so any programs which write to the
database should keep their lock use to a minimum or else this filter
will appear to hang while waiting for the lock operation to complete.

Features that involve specification of IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks
will use the
.I inet_addr(3)
function to parse that information.  Users should be familiar with the
way that function handles the non-trivial cases (for example, "192.0.2/24"
and "192.0.2.0/24" are not the same thing).
