INTRODUCTION
============

In the source code for this package may be one or more segments of code
that are disabled, as they are slated for future release (FFR).  These
are generally unreleased or incomplete features, or can be new algorithms
for existing features.  They are often untested and currently unsupported,
and generally formally become part of the released software in some future
revision.  There may or may not be documentation for them outside of this
file.  Use them at your own risk.

To enable an FFR in the source code, specify "--enable-featurename" when
executing "./configure".  For example, to add the "widget" feature, you would
add "--enable-widget" when executing "./configure".


FEATURES
========

Feature Name	Description

adsp_lists	Enables rejection of mail advertising an ADSP policy of
		"discardable" addressed to mailing lists.  (opendkim)

allsymbols	By default, the build will attempt to create a libopendkim
		that only exports symbols intended to be exported;
		internal-only functions are not visible.  This feature
		exports those as well.  This is intended only for running
		library unit tests.  (libopendkim)

atps		Support for experimental Authorized Third-Party Signatures
		mechanism.  (opendkim, libopendkim)

codecoverage	Enables generation of profiling code for all libraries,
		programs and tests.  When running the library tests,
		produces a report about code coverage based on the available
		code coverage tools (gprof, gcov or lcov). (all)

db_handle_pools	Database handle pools.  EXPERIMENTAL  (opendkim)

default_sender	Allow declaration of sender address to use when a message
		contains no obvious sender.  (opendkim)

diffheaders	When verification fails for a message for which a "z="
		tag was provided, compare the received headers to the original
		headers to look for possible munging.  Requires the tre
		library, available at http://laurikari.net/tre.
		(opendkim, libopendkim)

dkim_reputation	Add experimental support for querying an open DKIM reputation
		service.  The service's URL is http://www.dkim-reputation.org.
		(opendkim, libdkimrep, libopendkim)

identity_header	Enable selection of an identity for signing based on the
		value found in a particular header. (opendkim)

ldap_caching	Adds code that ensures duplicate LDAP queries aren't sent
		and local caching of LDAP replies is done.  (opendkim)

lua_globals	Optional mechanism for passing variables between Lua
		scripts.  (opendkim)

oversign	Optional specification of header fields to "oversign" to
		prevent malicious addition of malicious extra instances.
		(opendkim, libopendkim)

parsetime	Adds a utility function reporting the value of the Date:
		header for easy comparison to signature timestamps in order
		to detect messages in which those values wildly differ.
		INCOMPLETE.  (libopendkim)

poll		Instructs the asynchronous resolver to use poll() instead
		of select() to wait for I/O on sockets.  (libar)

popauth		POP-before-SMTP support.  (opendkim)

postgres_reconnect_hack
		libpq (the postgresql client library) fails to identify
		at least some error conditions as needing a connection
		to be restarted before a query can be completed.  This
		code compensates for that problem by checking for fatal
		errors in ad different (but unconventional) manner.  It is
		hoped that this can be removed in the near future.
		(opendkim)

query_cache	Support for local caching of key and policy queries rather
		than relying on the DNS to do so.  (libopendkim)

rate_limit	Experimental rate limiting based on confirmed signer domains.
		(opendkim)

rbl		Option to query realtime blacklists from within Lua scripts.
		Requires Lua.  (opendkim)

redirect	Option to redirect messages to a specific address on
		verification or ADSP failure.  (opendkim)

replace_rules	Allow specification of a "replacement rules" table
		for use when signing, replacing certain patterns in
		address headers with specific strings to anticipate the
		effects of such things as the "masquerade" and "genericstable"
		features of the sendmail MTA.  (opendkim)

reputation	Support for a collaborative reputation system.
		EXPERIMENTAL  (opendkim)

resign		Experimental API features for simultaneous verifying and
		re-signing of a single message.  (libopendkim, opendkim)

select_canonicalization
		Optionally override the value of the "-c" command line flag
		by specifying a preferred canonicalization in a special
		header field.  Intended mostly for testing, not production
		use.  (opendkim)

selector_header	Enable selection of which selector (and thus which key)
		to use when signing based on the contents of an arbitrary
		header field.  (opendkim)

sender_macro	Enable control over an MTA macro from which the address
		of the sender is taken, rather than from header fields.
		(opendkim)

stats		Optional generation of per-message and per-signature
		statistics of interest to the evolution of DKIM.
		See stats/README for information.  (opendkim)

statsext	Support for localized stats extensions.  See stats/README
		for information.  (opendkim)

vbr		Enable VBR (Vouch By Reference) header field addition
		(outbound) and processing (inbound).  (opendkim)

xtags		DKIM library extensions for adding arbitrary experimental
		signature tags and values.  (libopendkim)
