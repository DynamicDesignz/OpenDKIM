INTRODUCTION
============

In the source code for this package may be one or more segments of code
that are disabled, as they are slated for future release (FFR).  These
are generally unreleased or incomplete features, or can be new algorithms
for existing features.  They are often untested and currently unsupported,
and generally formally become part of the released software in some future
revision.  There may or may not be documentation for them outside of this
file.  Use them at your own risk.

To enable an FFR in the source code, specify "--enable-featurename" when
executing "./configure".  For example, to add the "widget" feature, you would
add "--enable-widget" when executing "./configure".


FEATURES
========

Feature Name	Description

allsymbols	By default, the build will attempt to create a libopendkim
		that only exports symbols intended to be exported;
		internal-only functions are not visible.  This feature
		exports those as well.  This is intended only for running
		library unit tests.  (libopendkim)

bodylength_db	Optionally query a local database of recipient addresses
		to determine if an "l=" tag should be applied when
		signing.  (opendkim)

capture_unknown_errors
		When dkim_eom() returns an unexpected error of some kind,
		quarantine the message for further analysis.  (opendkim)

codecoverage	Enables generation of profiling code for all libraries,
		programs and tests.  When running the library tests,
		produces a report about code coverage based on the available
		code coverage tools (gprof, gcov or lcov). (all)

default_sender	Allow declaration of sender address to use when a message
		contains no obvious sender.  (opendkim)

diffheaders	When verification fails for a message for which a "z="
		tag was provided, compare the received headers to the original
		headers to look for possible munging.  Requires the tre
		library, available at http://laurikari.net/tre.
		(opendkim, libopendkim)

dkim_reputation	Add experimental support for querying an open DKIM reputation
		service.  The service's URL is http://www.dkim-reputation.org.
		(opendkim, libopendkim)

dnsupgrade	Maintain two libar instances, the second in TCP mode, in case
		any UDP queries come back truncated.  Not meaningful unless
		libar is in use.  (libopendkim)

identity_header	Enable selection of an identity for signing based on the
		value found in a particular header. (opendkim)

ldap_caching	Adds code that ensures duplicate LDAP queries aren't sent
		and local caching of LDAP replies is done.  (opendkim)

parsetime	Adds a utility function reporting the value of the Date:
		header for easy comparison to signature timestamps in order
		to detect messages in which those values wildly differ.
		INCOMPLETE.  (libopendkim)

redirect	Option to redirect messages to a specific address on
		verification or ADSP failure.  (opendkim)

replace_rules	Allow specification of a "replacement rules" table
		for use when signing, replacing certain patterns in
		address headers with specific strings to anticipate the
		effects of the "masquerade" and "genericstable" features in
		the MTA.  (opendkim)

report_intervals
		Support for report intervals, part of the DKIM reporting
		extensions.  (opendkim)

resign		Experimental API features for simultaneous verifying and
		re-signing of a single message.  (libopendkim)

select_canonicalization
		Optionally override the value of the "-c" command line flag
		by specifying a preferred canonicalization on a special
		header line.  Intended mostly for testing, not production
		use.  (opendkim)

selector_header	Enable selection of which selector (and thus which key)
		to use when signing based on the contents of an arbitrary
		header.  (opendkim)

sender_macro	Enable control over an MTA macro from which the address
		of the sender is taken, rather than from header fields.
		(opendkim)

stats		Optional generation of statistics about pass/fail sorted
		by domain and canonicalization.  Requires Sleepycat DB.
		(opendkim)

vbr		Enable VBR (Vouch By Reference) header addition (outbound)
		and processing (inbound).  Under revision and may not be
		stable.  (opendkim)
