This listing shows the versions of the OpenDKIM package, the date of
release, and a summary of the changes in that release.

1.1.0		2009/08/31
	Add _FFR_IDENTITY_HEADER, to set an identity (i=) for signing based on 
        	the value found in a particular header.  Requested by
		Florian Sager.
	Fix inside dkimf_libstatus() to return extended status code 
		4.7.5 if temp-fail is due to key retrieval failure.
	Fix bug #SF2831720: Use new dynamic signature header generation
		code (see below).
	Add new exception handling code "keynotfound" (short form "key")
		and "On-KeyNotFound", which handles keys not found in DNS
		separately from other DNS errors.
	Fixes inside dkimf_libstatus() so that SMTP reply codes get set
		properly for temp-fails.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add dkim_getsighdr_d(), a dynamic-length version of
		dkim_getsighdr().  The old function interface remains
		unchanged for backward compatibility.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add dkim_dstring_printf().
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF2839858: Change "default_senderheaders" list
		to include only "from", per RFC5617.  Problem noted
		by Erik Lotspeich.
	Activate _FFR_SENDER_HEADERS, adding "SenderHeaders" to the
		configuration file.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2841499: Fix building of opendkim tools so that
		they link against libdb when necessary.
	BUILD: Fix building of libopendkim/t-test115 so it agrees with
		what SHA methods are found by libopendkim itself.
	BUILD: Don't bother building libar unless --enable-arlib is specified.

1.0.0		2009/08/14
	Initial release after code fork from dkim-milter package (v2.8.3).
	Fix bug #SF2813077: Don't do anything other than deliver messages
		when "t=y" is present in the verifying key record.  Problem
		noted by Jens Elkner.
	Fix bug #SF2835208: Set the signal mask earlier so that signals
		of interest aren't delivered to threads that can't handle
		them.  Problem noted by Mike Markley.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF2795523: Correct canonicalization problem
		when a CRLF is split across body chunks and consecutive
		blank line counting is in progress.  Reported by Mark
		Martinec.
	TESTS: Fix bug #SF2813058: Fix t-test117 so it doesn't fail if
		the DKIM_TMPDIR environment variable is set.  Problem
		noted by Jens Elkner.
	PORTABILITY: Fix bug #SF2813058: Fixes to t-test100 for
		Solaris 10 (64-bit).  Patch from Jens Elkner.
