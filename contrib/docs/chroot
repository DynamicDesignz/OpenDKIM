OPENDKIM CHROOT NOTES
=====================

Contributed by Andreas Schulze

Running opendkim chroot adds an additional layer of complexity. It is disabled
by default.  Only advanced users only should try to enable that special
configuration.  To successfull setup a chroot jail you must configure opendkim
to run *without* that restriction first!

enabling chroot jail
====================
chroot is enabled by adding "ChangeRootDirectory /path/to/chroot" to
opendkim.conf.  Then you must restart opendkim.

setting up syslog
=================
opendkim requieres a syslog socket inside the chroot.  You have to edit your
syslog daemon configuration.

  for rsyslog:
  $AddUnixListenSocket /path/to/chroot/dev/log"

  for syslog-ng:
  FIXME: Sample syslog-ng.conf

After restarting the syslog daemon you may want to check if the syslog socket
is really present.

  test -S /path/to/chroot/dev/log || echo "socket missing"

setting up resolving
====================
The next point is only required if opendkim is compiled with the optional code
option "USE_UNBOUND" and you activated "UnboundConfigFile" in opendkim.conf.
Then you must place the unbound configuration file inside /path/to/chroot. If
your unbound.conf includes other files such dnssec keys, these file must also
be placed inside /path/to/chroot.

  opendkim.conf:
  UnboundConfigFile	/inside_chroot/unbound.conf

BUG: opendkim -x does not handle chroot correctly:
     ChangeRootDirectory	/path/to/chroot
     UnboundConfigFile		/unbound.conf
-> opendkim -x should test /path/to/chroot/unbound.conf but fail.

setup entropie
==============
opendkim needs access to /dev/random or a similiar random generator.

simple signing setup
====================

  opendkim.conf:
  Mode		s
  Domain	example.org
  Selector	default
  KeyFile	/real/path/to/keyfile

In this case no further action is required.

more complex signing setup
==========================

  opendkim.conf:
  Mode		s
  SigningTable	refile:/real/path/to/signingtable
  KeyTable	file:/real/path/to/keytable

  /real/path/to/signingtable:
  *@example.org	examplekey

  /real/path/to/keytable:
  examplekey	example.org:default:/inside_chroot/key.private

You have to put your signing keys inside /path/to/chroot.

Validation
==========

postfix source includes scripts to setup minimal chroot directories.
These scripts may be used.
