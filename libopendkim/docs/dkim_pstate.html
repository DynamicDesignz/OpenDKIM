<th width="80">Purpose</th>
<td>A <tt>DKIM_PSTATE</tt> is an opaque structure which contains state
    information with respect to policy lookups. <p>

    DKIM policy evaluation is a multi-step process which can involve several
    queries to look up SSP or other information about a sending domain.  When
    a policy lookup callback is in use
    (see <tt><a href="dkim_set_policy_lookup.html">dkim_set_policy_lookup()</a></tt>),
    the callback might be unable to complete a particular lookup and thus
    return <tt>DKIM_CBSTAT_TRYAGAIN</tt>.  In such cases, it is likely
    desirable to resume the incomplete policy lookup when the calling
    application knows it can complete the query.  The <tt>DKIM_PSTATE</tt>
    is a state structure which is loaded with information required to resume
    a policy evaluation where a callback caused it to be suspended. <p>

    Before use, it should be allocated by the caller and cleared using
    <tt>bzero()</tt> or <tt>memset()</tt>.</td>
