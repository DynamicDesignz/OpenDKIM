<h1>DKIM Statistics</h1>
In v2.1.0, OpenDKIM introduced comprehensive statistics gathering package
included as an option.  If enabled, it logged to a local database information
about the DKIM properties of every message that the filter sees, including
those that weren't even signed.
<p>
The purpose of this statistics gathering was twofold:
<ol>
 <li> To gather statistics you could use to analyze what you're seeing at your
      site in terms of signed messages, unsigned messages, messages that
      fail verification, multiply-signed messages, third-party signatures, etc. 
 <li> To submit the above statistics, with most of the identifiable properties
      hidden if you wish, back to The Trusted Domain Project so we can measure
      DKIM's deployment, level of activity and general effectiveness, and
      possibly identify specific problem areas or interesting patterns.
</ol>
<p>
The data we collected were used to create the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/implementation/report-rfc4871.txt">RFC4871
Implementation Report</a> in support of the efforts of the DKIM Working Group
at the IETF to advance DKIM to Draft Standard status.  The Working Group
expresses its thanks to those that participated!
</p>

<p>
In v2.5.0, much of this mechanism is being stripped down as a lot of the
data collected back then is no longer needed.  Instead, a reduced
data set is being collected in support of research toward producing a
DKIM-based domain reputation system.  This system can be used to develop
localized reputation based only on your own observations about what is
acceptable mail and what is not, or you can submit it back to The OpenDKIM
Project to collaborate in the research and development of this system,
and benefit from it as it evolves.
</p>

<p>
You are <b>not</b> required to participate.  In fact, it is necessary to
provide a specific build-time option just to get the statistics stuff
compiled in (and the filter works <i>just fine</i> without doing so), and then
you'd need to take specific additional actions to submit the data back to The
OpenDKIM Project.  The data submitted will identify you as the submitter, and
the From: domain and the signing domain(s) of the mail it records will
be revealed, but no content or recipient information will be returned
to The Trusted Domain Project.  Since the source code is open, you can confirm
this for yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in experimenting with the statistics features or learning
more, download v2.2.0 or later and look at the <tt>README</tt> file in the
<tt>stats</tt> directory.
<p>
Please submit any questions about this effort to the opendkim-users
mailing list.
