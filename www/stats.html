<h1>DKIM Statistics</h1>
As of v2.1.0, OpenDKIM has a comprehensive statistics gathering package
included as an option.  If enabled, it will log to a database information
about the DKIM properties of every message that the filter sees, including
those that weren't even signed.
<p>
The purpose of this statistics gathering is twofold:
<ol>
 <li> To gather statistics you can use to analyze what you're seeing at your
      site in terms of signed messages, unsigned messages, messages that
      fail verification, messages that fail ADSP policy checks,
      multiply-signed messages, third-party signatures, etc. 
 <li> To submit the above statistics, with most of the identifiable properties
      hidden if you wish, back to The OpenDKIM Project so we can measure
      DKIM's deployment, level of activity and general effectiveness, and
      possibly identify specific problem areas.
</ol>
<p>
You are encouraged to participate in the latter.  This is being done in
conjunction with the Internet Engineering Task Force's DKIM Working Group,
the body that created the DKIM standard.  We will submit the names of any
company or person that contributes data as part of our report to that body
for appropriate credit.
<p>
You are <b>not</b> required to participate.  In fact, it is necessary to
specify a specific build-time option just to get the statistics stuff
compiled in (and the filter works <i>just fine</i> without doing so), and then
you'd need to take specific additional actions to submit the data back to The
OpenDKIM Project.  The data submitted will identify the submitter, but you
can choose to submit only hashes of the author domain of those messages;
this way we can't tell what the author domain was, but we can tell if two
different messages about which you submit data are from the same author
domain.  This is important for accurate data collection.
<p>
The submission mechanism on our side has not yet been installed and
configured.  This page will be updated, and an announcement sent out, once
that mechanism is up and working.
<p>
Please submit any questions about this effort to the opendkim-users
mailing list.
