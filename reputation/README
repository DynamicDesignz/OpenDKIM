INTRODUCTION

This area contains a snapshot of the ongoing development of a rudimentary
reputation system based on OpenDKIM's statistics package.

The statistics package is able to capture the flow of mail arriving as it
passes through OpenDKIM.  All messages, even unsigned ones, are recorded.
For signed messages, all signatures are recorded including pass/fail,
signing domain, certain signature properties, etc.  The statistics system
can also upload the locally-collected data to an arbitrary central repository
where it can be aggregated and then made available to participants to query.

This central system has not yet been designed to be queryable as a public
service, but may be in the future.  This directory contains a description
sufficient to build such a system, but also (and primarily) for building a
local store that can be used as an intelligent filter based on DKIM
verification results.

REQUIREMENTS

The requirements for this reputation system are as follows:

1) Reputation must be based on the domain(s) that have some kind of
   responsibility for the message.

2) Reputation should be expressed in such a way that it can be easily
   converted to a message flow limit.

3) There must be some reasonable, even if tiny, allowance made for
   domains about which no data have been accumulated.

4) The system may output a few values for a given domain, such as
   "strict", "medium" and "light", and these would be applied at the
   discretion of the implementation.

5) Data expiration must be configurable at the discretion of the site using
   the system.  That is, the system should neither impose a specific lifetime
   of the data accumulated, though it should discuss the impacts of different
   choices of data lifetime.


OVERVIEW

The system computes a recommended flow based on the history of the
behaviour of the signing domain(s) on a message.  Mail that is unsigned will
be treated as though it was signed by the NULL domain, meaning all unsigned
mail is presumed to come from a common source ("the unknown", as it were).
What remains, then, is to determine the perceived value of mail from each
of these sources.  This is done via data collection and statistical methods.

Full details of this system can be found in the white paper entitled
"Enforcing Rate Limits Based on Authenticated Sender Reputation",
included in this directory.
