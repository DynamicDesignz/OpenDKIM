Release procedures for OpenDKIM

1) Edit libopendkim/dkim.h and change OPENDKIM_LIB_VERSION to match the new
   release number.

2) Edit opendkim/opendkim.h and change DKIMF_VERSION to match the new
   release number.  Make sure any suffixes like ".dev" are removed.

3) Edit configure.ac so that the new release number is the second parameter
   in the AC_INIT() call.

4) Edit RELEASE_NOTES and set the date of the new version to today's date.

5) Commit the above changes to CVS.

6) In the root build directory, do these things:

	% make distclean
	% ./autogen.sh
	% ./configure
	% make dist

   This will produce an opendkim-(version).tar.gz tarball.

7) Generate an MD5 checksum of the tarball and write it to its own file:

	% md5 opendkim-(version).tar.gz > opendkim-(version).tar.gz.md5

8) Upload these two files and the RELEASE_NOTES to SourceForge:

	scp opendkim-(version).tar.gz \
		opendkim-(version).tar.gz.md5 RELEASE_NOTES \
		(userid),opendkim@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/o/op/opendkim/

   ...where (userid) is replaced by your SourceForge userid.  You'll need
   to have permissions in the SourceForge system to do file releases for
   the opendkim project, have added a public key to your account there,
   and be using an SSH agent with your private key.

9) Via the SourceForge UI, do the following things to the new files:

	a) mark RELEASE_NOTES as a release notes file by checking the box
	b) make the latest tarball the default download for Linux, Solaris
	   and BSD
	c) associate RELEASE_NOTES with the tarball

10) Prepare a release announcement by using the file "announcement" from CVS
    as your template.  Change the From: to the name and address of the person
    making the announcement.  Make sure that address has permissions to post
    to opendkim-users and opendkim-announce.  There should be a paragraph
    or two at the top highlighting the interesting changes and indicating
    what the main focus of this release is (new features, bug fixes, etc.),
    and then the full RELEASE_NOTES block for the new release.  Commit this
    to CVS.

11) Send the release announcement:

	% sendmail -t < announcement

12) Mark any bug fixes or feature requests, etc. as closed if this release
    contained them.

13) Update our entry on FreshMeat (http://www.freshmeat.net)
