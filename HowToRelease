Release procedures for OpenDKIM

1) Edit configure.ac so that the new release number is formed with the
   VERSION_RELEASE* macros.

2) In the root build directory, do these things:

	% make distclean
	% ./autogen.sh
	% ./configure
	% make distcheck

   This will produce an opendkim-(version).tar.gz tarball.

3) Commit changes made to RELEASE_NOTES and potentially libopendkim/dkim.h
   to CVS.

4) Check that everything looks correct.

5) Deploy all needed files to SourceForge by doing 'make push'.

6) Via the SourceForge UI, do the following things to the new files:

	a) mark RELEASE_NOTES as a release notes file by checking the box
	b) make the latest tarball the default download for Linux, Solaris
	   and BSD
	c) associate RELEASE_NOTES with the tarball

7) Prepare a release announcement by using the file "announcement" from CVS
   as your template.  Change the From: to the name and address of the person
   making the announcement.  Make sure that address has permissions to post
   to opendkim-users and opendkim-announce.  There should be a paragraph
   or two at the top highlighting the interesting changes and indicating
   what the main focus of this release is (new features, bug fixes, etc.),
   and then the full RELEASE_NOTES block for the new release.  Commit this
   to CVS.

8) Send the release announcement:

	% sendmail -t < announcement

9) Mark any bug fixes or feature requests, etc. as closed if this release
   contained them.

10) Update our entry on FreshMeat (http://www.freshmeat.net)
